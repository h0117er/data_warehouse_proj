# Unlocking Market Potential: Comprehensive EDA and Sales Strategy for Global E-Commerce

## Summary 

- While the "bikes" category occupied only 32.88%, 96.46% of the revenue was highlighted. 
- Regardless of the country, there were 2 major declines in ARPU. Every first month of each year, more than half of the ARPU decreased.
- Married Americans tended to lead the revenue after Nov 2012; however, the differences between marital status are not significant.
- These 3 models, Mountain-200, Road-350 and Touring-1000 lead to significant sales amounts, increasing by 10% of the prices.

As a result of the research, I suggest **focusing on only "bike" category**.
